## What is HEGL?

- A component, created in 2021 and developed in collaboration with [**HITS**](https://www.h-its.org), of the [**Research Station: *Geometry+Dynamics***](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~geodyn/) located at Heidelberg University.
- A *space* for students and faculty to engage in experimental mathematics.
- A *community* that brings researchers of all levels together.
- A *website* with a database of pedagogical resources.
- A member of [Geometry Labs United](https://geometrylabs.net), an association which works to promote research and public interest in geometry.

## The Lab

### Praktika 
*(Undergraduate Research Experience)*

HEGL provides support for semester-long projects for BA and MA students: **mentorship**, access to the Lab's **resources**.

The output can be:

::: {.incremental}
- A [blog entry](https://hegl.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/blog/) on the HEGL website.
- A computer application, [web-based](https://hegl.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/galleries/online-apps/) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/hegl-lab).
- A piece of mathematical artwork, such as a [3D printed](https://hegl.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/galleries/3d-printed-models/) object or a [hand-crafted](https://hegl.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/galleries/gallery/) one.
- A written report or a talk at the [HEGL Community Seminar](https://hegl.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/seminars/hegl-community-seminar/).

### Internships

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
<br> We offer BOGY internships for **high school students**.

They come to the lab for one or two weeks and work on a project involving experimental mathematics and **visualisation**.

### Outreach

We also engage in various activities designed to [communicate mathematics](https://hegl.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/outreach/) to the broader public:

::: {.incremental}
- [Public lectures](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~geodyn/Outreach/Public_Lectures.html).
- Participation of HEGL in [workshops and conferences](https://ms-math-computer.science/projects/dmv_math_art_23.html).
- Posters and [articles](https://structures.uni-heidelberg.de/news/STRUCTURES_Newsletter_2022_Apr.pdf) showcasing the Lab's activities.
- Exhibitions of [mathematical art](https://hegl.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/galleries/gallery/).
